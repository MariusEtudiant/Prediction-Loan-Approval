## 🏆 Competition Overview

Welcome to the **2024 Kaggle Playground Series**! This exciting competition offers an approachable yet challenging dataset designed to help the community practice and refine their machine learning skills. A new competition is anticipated each month, bringing fresh opportunities to learn and compete.

### 🎯 The Goal
The objective for this competition is to **predict whether an applicant is approved for a loan** based on the features provided in the dataset.

## 🚀 My Approach

To tackle this challenge, I implemented and experimented with **two different models**:

### 1️⃣ **Logistic Regression**
- **Why**: A simple yet effective baseline for binary classification problems.
- **Implementation**:
  - Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and normalize features.
  - Evaluated using metrics such as ROC-AUC and accuracy.

### 2️⃣ **Neural Network**
- **Why**: To explore the potential of deep learning for capturing complex patterns in the data.
- **Architecture**:
  - Input layer matching the feature dimensions.
  - Hidden layers with ReLU activations and dropout for regularization.
  - Output layer with a sigmoid activation for binary classification.
- **Training**:
  - Optimizer: Adam
  - Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
  - Early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## 📊 Results

- Logistic Regression provided a **strong baseline** with consistent performance.
- The Neural Network **outperformed the baseline**, capturing more complex patterns in the data.

Both approaches demonstrated their strengths, and the project highlights the importance of model selection and tuning for different datasets.
